# **Spectral Overhaul**

Main goals:

- Complex, but not too much
- Every playthrough is different
- New logistic challenges
- In research, more emphasis on discovery

HOW?
3 different kinds of each type of ore (fuel, structure, mechanics, electronics, oil). Only one of each group will be available in a given world.
The mod will contain three different material processing methods, 3 different logistics trees, 3 different power production methods..., each tied to the ore you got.
Each combination of processes, machines, transportation methods... will contain some unique challenges and will lead to unique designs.
In the late game, there would be a way to acquire one or even both remaining kinds of ore for each type. The two or three types should combine in a complex way to gain access to more power.
